<a name="context" class="anchor" href="#context"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Context</h3>

<p>You have just started a new project in a corporate and investment bank, and you have to improve quality and maintainability of an existing blotter application.</p>

<p>A blotter consists in a list of products displayed to users.</p>

<p>Product visibility depends of participant teams which are indicated on each product. A user who belongs to the team which is affected to a product as participant can show this product in its blotter. This rule is also suitable for subteams.</p>

<p>Three different types of blotter exist with specific rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>All products blotter which contains all products with tasks for user, user’s teams and user’s teams’ members.</li>
<li>Team blotter which contains only product with task for user, user’s teams and user’s teams’ members.</li>
<li>User blotter which contains only product with task for user, user’s teams.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="organization" class="anchor" href="#organization"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization</h3>

<p>Each user belongs to teams and have roles (sales, engineer or trader). Each team contains members which can be users or teams.</p>

<p>A task is assigned to a member (user or team) and a role.</p>

<a name="goal" class="anchor" href="#goal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goal</h3>

<p>Refactor existing application by reducing complexity of task and product repositories.</p>
